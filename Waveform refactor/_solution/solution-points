Issues Discovered:

1. Nested loops: they always trigger performance warnings (O(N * M) complexity on Big-O notation). If it's strictly necessary to do it, we have to evaluate what can be done outside of the loop.
2. Running a performance evaluation using Chrome Devtools, I confirmed the warning inside of the nested loop (see screenshots of test-1-waveform).
3. Inside of the nested loop, I found ctx.fillStyle was being defined multiple times and wasn't linked with the variable of the loop (y).
 I decided to put it outside, also because in Canvas, you can define the filStyle, but the shape is not painted until you use the fillRect or similar.
 I ran again the Performance Evaluation of Chrome, and it confirmed the performance of this line was improved from 4200ms to 350ms (see screenshot test2-waveform-short)

4. Variables width and height: those were not linked to the loop variable (x), I decided to place their definition outside.
This improved the performance time from 15ms to 0.1ms, each line.
